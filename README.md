<h1>Summary</h1>
The project utilizes a ML python app to predict housing prices in Boston to be run in a docker container orchastrated by Kubernetes.

<h1> Files: </h1>

Dockerfile - Has the file required to dockerizing the python app
.circleci/config.yml - has the file for CircleCI to automatically run tests and build the app. 
requirements.txt - Has the required dependencies for the python app
upload_docker.sh - Uploads the docker file to Docker Hub
run_docker.sh - Will run the docker container
run_kubernetes - Scheduled and Runs the app as a pod in kubernetes
app.py - Is the file that is the python app
Makefile - Has set of commands to perform activities like install, lint, etc.,
make_prediction.sh - Performs a call to the API to perform prediction
model_data - folder has the required input file for the prediction model


<h1> How to run </h1>

Make sure minikube is installed. 

nstall Minikube
To run a Kubernetes cluster locally, for testing and project purposes, you need the Kubernetes package, Minikube. This operates in a virtual machine and so you'll need to download two things: A virtual machine (aka a hypervisor) then minikube. Thorough installation instructions can be found here. Here is how I installed minikube:

Install VirtualBox:

For Mac:

brew cask install virtualbox
For Windows, I recommend using a Windows host.

Install minikube:

For Mac:

brew cask install minikube
For Windows, I recommend using the Windows installer.

1. Start minikube
<pre><code>minikube start</pre></code>

2. Run Kubernetes
<pre><code>./run_kubernetes.sh</pre></code>

3. On a separate tab, call the script to make prediction.
<pre><code>./make_prediction2.sh</pre></code>

4. Once done,delete the minikube
<pre><code>minikube delete</pre></code>
